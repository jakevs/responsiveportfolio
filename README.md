Homework 2 - Responsive Portfolio

In this assignment, I made a webpage with three different pages that can be linked to on any of the pages using the Navbar. I made the webpages responsive, so they will be asthetically pleasing on all size screens for the user. This means making the Navbar, layout and images all responsive elements. I used Bootstrap so that I would not have to write out media queries, like when writing pure CSS. I had to play with some of the Bootstrap elements to make the page work, and clean up semantics, but I am happy with what I came up with. I ended up redoing my original Navbar that I had made from scratch, with an example from Bootstrap and edited that. It also, took me a while to get the text to wrap around the image in the index file, but satisfying when I finally got it to work. I enjoy working with the grid because it makes sense to me. I tested the pages on different sized screens, including my cell phone, and everything seems to be working as far as responsiveness and links working.
