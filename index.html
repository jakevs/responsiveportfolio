                Full-stack web developer with a background in psychology and
                problem solving, with the intent of building user friendly
                experiences in apps and web pages. Currently taking the
                University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp, gaining skills in HTML,
                CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, MongoDB, and React.js. Focused
                on developing highly intuitive web pages and applications that
                will help clients and users enjoy their experience. Discovered a
                fascination with all of the possibilities derived from web
                development, and the limitless knowledge available.

                Team player that enjoys collaborating with others on projects to
                create amazing web pages. I would be a strong addition to an
                organization with qualities like leadership, a passion for
                learning, and a love for web development.
              </p>

                I am also a husband and proud father of 2 beautiful children.
                This is probably my most important job. Before entering this
                industry, I have been in several different industries. I was in
                the service industry for many years, the moving industy,
                insurance industry, and most recently the fire protection
                industry. Some of my friends and co-workers call me a Jack of
                all trades. I'm hoping to add Web Development to my list of
                trades!
