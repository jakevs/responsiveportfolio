              <p>My name is James Van Slyke, and am currently taking the KU Coding Boot Camp. I have had an interest in computers and design for many years, and finally decided pulled the trigger to take this class and get started in the industry! So far I am embedded in HTML, CSS and Javascript and have found it to be quite interesting and even a little fun! I really hope to make this a new career and am very excited about the potential opportunities that I could have. Many friends of mine are in the industry and have convinced me that it will be a great decision to get started now. </p>
              <p>I am also a proud father of 2 beautiful children, and a husband. This is probably my most important job. Before entering this industry, I have been in several different industries. I was in the service industry for many years, the moving industy, insurance industry, and most recently the fire protection industry. Some people would call me a Jack of all trades.</p>
